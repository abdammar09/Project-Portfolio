In this course re-design project I created digital read + write  laboratory manuals for PHYS 121/122($1^{st}$ Year Electromagnetics University Course) using Python and Markdown in Jupyter Notebooks to familiarize students with modern data collection and analytical methods. I assisted in designing and integrating original laboratory experiments into the PHYS 121/122 course curriculum, including conducting tests to verify hypotheses and assess safety risks.

<br>
I created custom Python functions to automate data processing for empirical data collection, compute derived quantities and intermediate variables, regression methods for multivariable modeling, and statistical testing such as histograms, and data distributions.
<br>
Here are some images of generated plots using these functions

I also fabricated and assembled apparatus parts such as wooden lab jacks, support guides, and capillary tubing for reproducible lab experiments.

Modeled and 3D-printed experiment equipment like variable magnet spacers using Solidworks.
