## Project Overview
In this course enhancement project I contributed to developing a large digital question bank with **algorithmic random number generation** in the Prairie learn API for the engineering mechanics course (Dynamics - APSC181) to implement a mastery of learning approach. I formulated 30+ unique APSC 181 questions for tutorials, assignments, and midterms, focusing on engineering applications. I coded questions in Markdown and Python using scripts. I utilized an inverse kinematics-based question creation framework to eliminate extraneous randomly generated values and ensure real-world conformity. I also maintained and documented code while tracking project issues on GitHub using Issue Tracker, Milestones, and Discussions with other project contributors.

Please navigate to these links to view(and maybe attempt :) ) some of the questions I developed for the problem bank.
