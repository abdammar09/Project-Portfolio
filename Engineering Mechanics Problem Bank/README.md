## Project Overview
In this course enhancement project I contributed to developing a large digital question bank with **algorithmic random number generation** in the Prairie learn API for the engineering mechanics course (Dynamics - APSC181) to implement a mastery of learning approach. I formulated 30+ unique APSC 181 questions for tutorials, assignments, and midterms, focusing on engineering applications. I coded questions in Markdown and Python using scripts. I utilized an inverse kinematics-based question creation framework to eliminate extraneous randomly generated values and ensure real-world conformity. I also maintained and documented code while tracking project issues on GitHub using Issue Tracker, Milestones, and Discussions with other project contributors.

Please navigate to these links to view(and maybe attempt) some of the questions I developed for the problem bank.
