Hello! and welcome to my GitHub repository. My name is Ammar Zavahir and I am currently in my $4^{th}$ year of Electrical Engineering at the University of British Columbia-Okanagan. I am passionate about delivering software- and hardware-based solutions to complex problems in the education, healthcare, and sustainability domains. I am skilled in mixed-signal hardware design, digital signal processing (DSP), embedded systems design, and automation.

In this repository, I have included samples of my work contributions to university course development projects.
